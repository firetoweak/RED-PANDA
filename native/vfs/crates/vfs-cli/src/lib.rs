//! Thin CLI edge for Vfs.
//!
//! The CLI crate owns argument parsing, user-facing command output, process
//! exit/reporting behavior, and runtime config assembly. Filesystem semantics,
//! transport adapters, and mount lifecycle code live in `vfs-core`,
//! `vfs-fuse`, `vfs-nfs`, and `vfs-mount` respectively.
//!
//! Owned invariants:
//!
//! - One error reporter: handler results flow back to `main`, which prints
//!   the single `Error:` form and exits 1; child-status passthrough is the
//!   only sanctioned direct `process::exit`, and every hard-exit site
//!   flushes the profile report sink first.
//! - Config at the edge: CLI flags and env are resolved here into typed
//!   options before core/transport code runs; every runtime knob is
//!   declared in the `knobs` ledger that generates docs/KNOBS.md.
//! - Generated docs parity: the docs/MANUAL.md command reference is
//!   rendered from the clap tree by `docs` and pinned by tests, so help
//!   output and the manual cannot drift.
