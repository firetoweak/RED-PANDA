# Vfs

This fork adds a Windows filesystem foundation to Factory VFS v1.1.1.
Windows support currently covers the Rust core and opt-in WinFsp mount library;
the Unix CLI has not been ported. The fork uses schema 0.10 and refuses older
formats. See [Windows support and ownership](docs/WINDOWS.md) for build
requirements, capability limits and the application boundary.

The upstream usage examples below describe the Unix workflows. Historical
artifact version numbers in those examples are not accepted by this fork.


**The filesystem for agents.** A SQLite-backed virtual filesystem with
copy-on-write sandboxing, mountable over FUSE or NFS — whose live sessions
seal into a single verifiable file and resume on another machine with the
agent's uncommitted work intact.

> **⚠️ Beta.** Use caution with production data and keep backups.

## Teleporting a live session

An agent is mid-task on your laptop: dirty working tree, staged and unstaged
edits split across files, untracked scratch files, a couple of local commits.
Move all of it to another machine:

```console
# --- sender ---------------------------------------------------------------
$ vfs run --session demo --seed-pin "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" -- bash
# ... agent works. exit when it's time to hand off ...

$ vfs pack demo --output /tmp/artifact.db
{"sessionId":"demo","dbSha256":"0c7a79…","dbSizeBytes":122880,"artifactVersion":"0.6",
 "chunks":[{"index":0,"sizeBytes":122880,"sha256":"0c7a79…"}],"basePin":"6b8da73…",
 "seededPaths":[".git/HEAD",".git/index","main.rs","untracked.txt"],"generation":1}

# --- receiver: a pristine checkout at the same commit ---------------------
$ vfs adopt demo --db /tmp/artifact.db --base ~/src/checkout
{"sessionId":"demo","basePin":"6b8da73…","generation":1,"schemaVersion":"0.6", …}

$ vfs run --session demo -- git status --short
 M main.rs
?? inside.txt
?? untracked.txt
```

Same working tree, same staged-vs-unstaged split, same sandbox. The artifact
is a *delta* — it carries what the session changed, not the repository — so
the transfer is proportional to the work done, not to the size of the repo.

Point it at the wrong base and it refuses before touching anything:

```console
$ vfs adopt demo --db /tmp/artifact.db --base ./some-other-commit
Error: base checkout ./some-other-commit is at 3cf0b0a…, but the session requires
pin 6b8da73…; check out the pin before adopting
```

## Getting started

Install the latest release — the installer picks the right build for your
platform (Linux and macOS, x86_64 and arm64) and puts `vfs` plus a
`vfs-cli-update` self-updater in `$CARGO_HOME/bin` (default `~/.cargo/bin`):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/Factory-AI/vfs/releases/latest/download/vfs-cli-installer.sh | sh
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo +nightly build --release --workspace --bins
install -m 0755 target/release/vfs ~/.local/bin/
```

Initialize a filesystem and inspect it without ever mounting:

```console
$ vfs init my-agent
Created agent filesystem: .vfs/my-agent.db
Agent ID: my-agent

$ vfs fs my-agent ls
f hello.txt

$ vfs fs my-agent cat hello.txt
hello from agent
```

Read the agent's tool-call timeline:

```console
$ vfs timeline my-agent
ID   TOOL                 STATUS       DURATION STARTED
4    execute_code         pending            -- 2024-01-05 09:44:20
3    api_call             error           300ms 2024-01-05 09:44:15
2    read_file            success          50ms 2024-01-05 09:44:10
1    web_search           success        1200ms 2024-01-05 09:43:45
```

Mount it as a real filesystem (FUSE on Linux, NFS on macOS):

```console
$ vfs mount my-agent ./mnt
$ echo "hello" > ./mnt/hello.txt
```

Or sandbox a program over your current directory — copy-on-write, host
untouched:

```console
$ vfs run --session my-session -- bash
# ... every write lands in the delta database ...
$ exit

$ vfs ps
$ vfs diff my-session
```

## Forking a live session

Try a risky refactor without betting the session on it. `vfs branch` forks a
session into an independent one that starts at the parent's exact current
state — including a *running* parent, snapshotted through its mount without
stopping it:

```console
$ vfs branch demo --session probe
{"manifestVersion":1,"sessionId":"probe","parentSessionId":"demo",
 "parentArtifactSha256":"4b0dc4a…","artifactPath":"…/.vfs/artifacts/4b0dc4a….db",
 "basePath":"/home/you/src/checkout","seedPin":"6b8da73…","parentLive":true,
 "vfsVersion":"1.1.0"}

$ vfs run --session probe -- bash -c 'printf "risky refactor\n" > experiment.txt'

$ vfs run --session demo -- cat experiment.txt
cat: experiment.txt: No such file or directory
```

The fork is a delta over a frozen, content-addressed snapshot in
`~/.vfs/artifacts/<sha256>.db`, so branches taken at the same state share one
artifact and the branch itself starts empty. Any run of the parent is a new
state (every run leaves an audit row), so fork–run–fork produces two
artifacts. The branch mounts as a stack — its delta over the read-only parent
snapshot over the host base — and every mount re-hashes the snapshot first: a
missing or tampered parent refuses to serve rather than presenting a view
that is not the branched state. Branches of branches chain the same way, and
`vfs pack` of a branch folds the whole chain into one self-contained
artifact, so a forked session teleports like any other. Unreferenced
snapshots are collected with `vfs prune artifacts`.

## Replaying and reverting filesystem history

Every committed filesystem mutation is journaled as complete row deltas.
Immutable root snapshots bound replay, so Vfs can reconstruct any retained
complete-transaction boundary without interpreting operation-specific logs.
`vfs history` lists those boundaries, `vfs branch --to` forks one without
changing the parent, and offline `vfs revert` publishes a checked reconstruction
back over the session. Retention advances the oldest available boundary; Vfs
refuses targets outside the advertised floor/head range.

Against a stopped session, the full flow is:

```console
$ vfs run --session history-demo -- sh -c 'printf "version one\n" > draft.txt'
$ FIRST_HEAD="$(vfs history history-demo --json |
    python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["historyHeadSeq"])')"

$ vfs run --session history-demo -- sh -c 'printf "version two\n" > draft.txt'
$ vfs branch history-demo --to "$FIRST_HEAD" --session history-probe
{"manifestVersion":1,"sessionId":"history-probe",…,"targetSeq":6,…}

$ vfs run --session history-probe -- cat draft.txt
version one

$ vfs revert history-demo --to "$FIRST_HEAD"
Reverted session history-demo to history sequence 6.
Generation: 1
Database: /home/you/.vfs/run/history-demo/delta.db
$ vfs run --session history-demo -- cat draft.txt
version one
```

Revert rewinds filesystem and overlay state only. KV values and the tool-call
audit trail remain intact, and the restored state becomes the new history
floor rather than preserving a forked future.

## Checkpointing to a remote tier

`vfs checkpoint` publishes a consistent point of a session to S3-compatible
object storage (or a `file://` path — same wire, no credentials). The remote
holds three kinds of objects: content-addressed chunk bytes shared by every
session under the prefix, an immutable *metadata artifact* per checkpoint —
the whole database with chunk bytes hollowed out — and one mutable
`manifest.json` per session. The manifest write is the only commit point:
until it lands and reads back verbatim, the checkpoint did not happen.

```console
$ export VFS_REMOTE_URL="file:///tmp/vfs-remote"
$ vfs run --session remote-demo -- sh -c 'dd if=/dev/urandom of=data.bin bs=64K count=4 status=none'
$ vfs checkpoint remote-demo --json
{"sessionId":"remote-demo","seq":10,…,"uploadedChunks":5,"reusedChunks":0,…}

$ vfs checkpoint remote-demo --json   # nothing changed; nothing re-uploads
{"sessionId":"remote-demo","seq":10,…,"uploadedChunks":0,"reusedChunks":5,…}
```

Live sessions checkpoint through the mount's control socket after a drain, so
every write acknowledged before the call is covered — the seq token in the
output names exactly the state the remote now holds. While a session runs
with `VFS_REMOTE_URL` set, a background streamer uploads chunk objects ahead
of time so the explicit checkpoint has less left to ship; it never touches
the manifest, so consistency points stay the ones you asked for.

The metadata artifact is a wire shape, not a live database: a writable open
refuses it unless a chunk source backs it (which is exactly what
`adopt --remote` arranges below), `vfs integrity` names its state,
`--require-portable` fails it, and `vfs backup` rejects it. Branch sessions
fold their parent chain before upload, so the remote stays branch-agnostic
like `pack`. Encrypted sessions refuse to checkpoint — shipping plaintext
chunks from an at-rest-encrypted database would quietly undo the encryption.

## Adopting from the remote tier

`vfs adopt --remote` installs a session directly from the checkpoint tier —
no artifact file changes hands. It fetches the manifest, verifies the
metadata artifact against the recorded SHA-256, migrates it forward, checks
the receiver's checkout against the seed pin, and publishes with the same
single rename every adopt uses. What lands is *lazy*: metadata is all local,
chunk bytes stay remote, and the first read of each chunk fetches it by
digest, BLAKE3-verifies it, and caches it in the database.

```console
# --- receiver: a checkout at the session's seed pin -----------------------
$ export VFS_REMOTE_URL="file:///tmp/vfs-remote"
$ vfs adopt remote-demo --remote --base ~/src/checkout
{"manifestVersion":1,"sessionId":"remote-demo",…,"remote":true}

$ vfs run --session remote-demo -- sha256sum data.bin   # faults the file's chunks
ba09e4…  data.bin
```

Adopt records the remote's URL in the session store, so resumed runs fault
against the same tier without any environment — `VFS_REMOTE_URL` stays a
checkpoint-side knob. A read that cannot reach the remote fails loudly with
an I/O error; you never get silent zeros. The session is fully usable while
lazy — partial writes and truncations fetch the chunks they modify — but it
cannot leave the machine in that state: `pack`, `branch`, `revert`,
`checkpoint`, and `backup` all refuse until the remote dependency is gone:

```console
$ vfs materialize remote-demo --in-place
Hydrated chunks: 4
$ vfs pack remote-demo --output /tmp/artifact.db   # now succeeds
```

Materializing in place fetches every remaining chunk in one all-or-nothing
transaction, drops the recorded remote, and re-verifies integrity; run it
twice and the second pass is a no-op. `backup --materialize` and
`materialize --output` do the same for copies.

## The rest of the CLI

* `vfs exec` — one-shot command over a temporary mount, unmounted after.
* `vfs clone` — bulk-ingest a git repository straight into the database.
* `vfs serve nfs` / `vfs serve mcp` — export over NFS, or expose filesystem
  and KV tools to agents over MCP.
* `--key` / `--cipher` — local at-rest encryption.
* `vfs backup`, `integrity`, `migrate`, `materialize`, `prune` — portable
  backups, corruption checks, schema migration, partial-origin
  materialization, mount and artifact-store cleanup.

The **[User Manual](docs/MANUAL.md)** documents every command; its reference
is generated from the CLI's own argument definitions, so it cannot drift from
`vfs --help`.

## Why it's a database

Vfs stores everything an agent does — every file it writes, every piece of
key-value state, every tool call — in one SQLite file. Four properties fall
out that ordinary filesystems don't have:

* **Auditable** — every file operation and tool call is queryable with SQL.
* **Reproducible** — snapshot state by copying one file; restore to replay an
  exact execution or roll back a mistake.
* **Portable** — files, state, and history move between machines as one `.db`.
* **Transferable** — a *running* sandbox session becomes a verifiable
  artifact, mid-flight.

For coding-agent workloads, Vfs layers that database over a read-only view of
the host: reads are scoped to the configured base tree, writes land only in
the delta database, and the real filesystem is never modified. That holds
against a prompt-injected agent too — the isolation is enforced at the
filesystem layer, not by convention.

## What makes the handoff trustworthy

Transferring a live session is easy to do *almost* correctly, and an almost
correct session is worse than a failed one: it looks fine and is subtly wrong.
Five properties keep it honest.

**Dirty state is captured, not read through.** A session over a dirty checkout
sees that dirt only via overlay base read-through, which does not travel.
`seed` imports dirty and untracked files, records deletions as whiteouts, and
ships local-only commits as a compact git pack plus the sender's raw index
bytes — which is what preserves staged-vs-unstaged. Git-ignored files are
excluded by design: build outputs and caches stay base-local.

**Pack is atomic and refuses live sessions.** It takes the exclusive session
lock, rejects live mounts and owner/joiner processes with exit code `3`, then
does every mutation — pruning, migration, generation bump, checkpoint,
compaction — on a private staging copy. Publication is a rename dance with
rollback; a pack that dies between renames is rolled forward by the next one.

**The artifact is content-addressed and version-negotiated.** The manifest
carries a whole-file `dbSha256` plus per-chunk digests over `--chunk-size`
ranges, so a transport can stream, verify chunk-by-chunk, ingest out of order,
and resume across daemon restarts. `vfs version --json` publishes
`artifactVersion` and `minSupportedArtifactVersion`, so two daemons agree on a
floor before a byte moves — a receiver behind on vfs fails preflight instead
of corrupting state.

**Adopt verifies provenance before it publishes.** The receiving checkout's
`HEAD` must equal the seed pin recorded *inside* the artifact. Install is
staged and committed by one rename, so a partial or corrupt session is never
observable — and the store layout stays private to `vfs` rather than becoming
a contract every receiver reimplements.

**Resume recovers, it doesn't assume.** Every start runs a recovery ladder
under the session lock: roll forward an interrupted pack, detach a stale
mount, reap dead proc records. Liveness comes from advisory locks and proc
records that the kernel releases on process death, which is what makes the
classification crash-consistent rather than heuristic. `vfs status --json`
reports `stopped | busy | live | stale-recovered` and runs the same recovery,
so a supervising daemon reads a truthful state:

```console
$ vfs status demo --json
{"sessionId":"demo","state":"stopped","mounted":false,"pid":null,"generation":1,"seeded":true}
```

Startup failures use reserved exit statuses — `3` live, `4` mount/sandbox
install failed, `5` session missing or malformed, `126`/`127` exec conventions
— so a daemon can branch on them. The wrapped command's own status passes
through untouched. Full contract in [docs/MANUAL.md](docs/MANUAL.md).

## How it works

At the core is the [agent filesystem](docs/SPEC.md), a SQLite storage system
built on [Turso](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso). The schema separates
namespace (dentries) from data (inodes + chunked/inline content), which is
what buys hard links, POSIX metadata, sparse files, and SQL-queryable history.
Schema v0.8 content-addresses file chunks, records replayable row deltas, and
pins immutable root snapshots. Session metadata remains inside the same file,
which is why pack generation, seed provenance, and retained history travel
with an artifact instead of depending on sidecars left on the sender.

On Linux the FUSE backend dispatches through a bounded worker pool with a
read/write lane split, kernel-cache acceleration (entry/attr TTLs, writeback
cache, readdirplus), zero-message opens, and an optional FUSE-over-io_uring
transport. Every one of those is an acceleration structure reconstructible
from the database: the two safety properties — one portable database holds all
virtual filesystem state, and sandboxed writes never reach the host — hold
regardless of cache configuration. Tunables are declared in the generated
[docs/KNOBS.md](docs/KNOBS.md) ledger.

## Using Vfs as a library

`vfs-core` exposes the same engine the CLI uses: filesystem, key-value store,
and tool-call audit trail over one database. See `cargo doc -p vfs-core`.

## Relationship to upstream AgentFS

Vfs is a hard fork of [tursodatabase/agentfs](https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs),
diverged at 0.6.4 and maintained by Factory. Not a drop-in replacement: the
binary is `vfs`, the crates are `vfs-*`, and the non-Rust SDKs are gone. Three
campaigns account for the distance.

**Performance** ([#2](https://github.com/Factory-AI/vfs/pull/2)) — closing the
gap against native git on the canonical codex workload. Kernel entry/attr
TTLs, ENOSYS-FLUSH and ENOSYS-OPEN protocol levers, a FUSE-over-io_uring
transport, a cross-inode write batcher, bulk+streamed `clone`. Per-phase
wall-clock vs native git, median-of-5:

| phase | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | ~1.9x | **0.60–0.93x** |
| `diff` | ~80ms | **18ms (0.05x)** |
| `checkout` | — | **0.42x** |
| `fsck` | — | **0.83x** |
| `read_search` | ~4.7x | **1.37–1.41x** |
| `clone` | 9.6x | **2.22x** |

Every remaining miss carries a named, measured floor rather than a shrug —
the warm read path bottoms out on kernel close-time `STATX_BLOCKS`
invalidation, for which a kernel patch is written and VM-validated.

**Restructure** ([#3](https://github.com/Factory-AI/vfs/pull/3)) — a
9,338-line god-file and two vendored crate forks leaking as public API became
five crates in a clean DAG. 96 ad-hoc knobs became typed declarations with a
generated ledger; one `Semantics` layer now serves both adapters, making
FUSE/NFS drift structurally impossible; the CI gate stopped masking its own
failures. Plus the correctness work that surfaced: FUSE teardown deadlocks on
*both* transports, an NFS `FILE_SYNC`-without-durability lie, overlay
base-rename data loss, and default-deny read scoping in the macOS Seatbelt
profile. Sealed by 176 behavioral contract assertions, pjdfstest 311/311, and
all seven benchmark phases held within a 5% band.

**Session handoff** ([#4](https://github.com/Factory-AI/vfs/pull/4)–[#9](https://github.com/Factory-AI/vfs/pull/9))
— the pipeline this README opens with: `seed` → `pack` → `adopt`, resumable
sessions with a recovery ladder, `vfs status` preflight, the reserved
exit-status contract, and the versioned content-addressed wire contract.
Schema v0.6 lands here too, so provenance rides inside the artifact.

Upstream's Go, Python, and TypeScript SDKs, the `examples/` tree, the
experimental ptrace sandbox, the Windows target, and the 17-feature `abi-7-*`
FUSE matrix were deleted rather than carried. See the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

Vfs is the session substrate behind Factory Droid's portable sessions and live
session handoff, which is what drives the contracts above.

## Repository layout

One Cargo workspace, five crates:

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `crates/vfs-core` | The engine: storage, overlay/copy-on-write, schema authority, typed config, telemetry, semantics (access/durability/handles). The only crate meant for external consumption. |
| `crates/vfs-fuse` | Sealed Linux FUSE mount surface (transport + adapter). |
| `crates/vfs-nfs` | Sealed NFSv3 serve surface (transport + adapter). |
| `crates/vfs-mount` | One mount lifecycle: `mount_fs`, `MountHandle`, supervision, daemonize. |
| `crates/vfs-cli` | The `vfs` binary: thin CLI edge over the crates above. |

**Linux is first-tier** (FUSE and NFS backends, `vfs run` sandbox, full
validation gate). **macOS is second-tier**: NFS mount plus a sandboxed `vfs
run` (Seatbelt with default-deny read scoping). CI exercises the macOS
runtime for real — the NFS mount path, the Seatbelt read-scoping check, and
the remote-tier suites all run on macos-latest — leaving a short list of
Seatbelt spot-checks to real hardware; see
[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md). No other platforms are supported.

## FAQ

### How is Vfs different from _X_?

[Bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) gives you filesystem isolation via namespaces and overlays; a `bwrap` call mounting `/` read-only with `--tmp-overlay` on the working directory gets you close. The difference is persistence and queryability: in Vfs the upper filesystem is one SQLite file you can query, snapshot, and move to another machine.

[Docker Sandbox](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-sandboxes-a-new-approach-for-coding-agent-safety/) is complementary, not competing. Vfs answers "what happened and what's the state?"; Docker Sandboxes answer "how do I run this safely?" Run the agent in a Docker Sandbox and use Vfs inside it for state and audit.

[Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) give agents independent copies of the source — but nothing stops an agent from writing outside its worktree, into another agent's worktree or system files. That isolation is conventional. Vfs enforces copy-on-write isolation below git, so it also covers untracked files.

### Why the filesystem layer instead of containers or VMs?

Structured SQLite tables mean you can *query* the filesystem, which is what makes agent behavior auditable and debuggable. SQLite's write-ahead log gives snapshotting and time-travel forking. And the engine runs where mounting a block device is impossible. It composes with containers and VMs rather than replacing them: Vfs is reachable over NFS or virtio-fuse.

### Why pin a transferred session to a git commit?

Because the artifact is a delta layered over a base checkout that stays on
disk — that's what keeps a handoff proportional to the work done. A delta only
reconstructs the sender's view if the receiver's base is byte-identical, so
adopt verifies the checkout against the pin recorded inside the artifact and
refuses otherwise. Adopting onto the wrong base would produce a session that
looks fine and is quietly wrong.
